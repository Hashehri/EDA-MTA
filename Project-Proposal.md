# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Projects of MTA Turnstile Data:
Hatim Alshehri

## Abstract:
The project goal would be an identification of the subway stations that have the most crowded,
to help an Ads agency target crowds from busy stations and present its marketing products. For
these, I will analyze the visitors of all stations and identify the busiest stations to target.
As a result, the crowds will be shown and detected on the live graph based on congestion time.

## Design:
The project utilizes a dataset provided by the MTA that helps in getting information regarding
the stations especially the turnstiles information. MTA APIs for Plotly graphs and line logos.
Therefore, the design detects congestions based on stations exits, entries between morning 
and evening. After detecting, the model will generate a live graph for spotting congestions, to 
enable the Ads agencies to take action to improve ads operations and pay attention to the busy stations.

## Data:
he dataset contains over 2.7 million observations in the period from August to October of 2021 with 11 columns. A few feature highlights include numbers of entries/exits for each station. In addtion, using MTA maps dataset for individual features for each station by using latitude/longitude coordinates and it contians 496 rows Ã— 14 columns.
